# ICP Starting Place

## Overview

I must say it's a little bit late when I decide to create this repo. When this idea come up, I have already been in IC network for months. There are many things need to write down for beginners to easily approach IC, especially when IC is new and don't have much information.

This is where I storage all little things that beginners will be struggled when working on IC network. Everything comes from my own experiences, so I will make it as easily to understand as I can, like friends help each other, hihi.

I know it's hard at the beginning. Believe me, I started without knowing a thing, but I keep learning everyday. I know you can too!!
